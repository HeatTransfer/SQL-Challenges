# Objective

Welcome to the SQL Challenges repository! This repository contains a variety of SQL problems designed to test and improve SQL skills. This repository consists various SQL challenges from variety of sources - youtube, linkedin, company interviews etc. 

## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. This repository is created to provide practical challenges that cover a wide range of SQL topics, from basic SELECT statements to complex JOINs, subqueries, Window functions, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with these challenges, you'll need a SQL environment. You can use any SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server. Here are some steps to set up a local environment:

1. **Install a DBMS:**
   - [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
   - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
   - [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
  
   <i>N.B. I have used MySQL to tackle the challenges.</i>

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HeatTransfer/SQL-Challenges.git
   cd SQL-Challenges
